## Description
Pet Social is a web app I created, where pet-lovers can be all about their pets.  Users can post photos, include a description and location on each photo.  Users can also like and comment on other user posts as well.  This idea is a mock-up of a social media site - but - instead of users posting about themselves and their daily encounters - this site is all about their furry (or not so furry) besties!  My focus here was to create a 'feel good' interactional web app.  A network for pet-lovers to boast, show their love, and possibly even ask eachother for pet advice and care suggestions.  The goal was simply to create something that would keep users smiling, and thus engaged.  Animals are often a huge part of our human lives, so often that we build strong, loving, and deep bonds with our pets - so why not have a designated space for our little pals we love so much?  I am sure your probably thinking: what about facebook, snapchat, tictoc, and instagram?  Thats fair, but I say to you: none of these are pet focused, and can often be associated with negativity depending on what the user posts...also, often the user will have to create a 'pet page' to generate views and likes.

This idea..yet again...was not my first original idea - and really started out super basic.  I had no idea I would end up loving the finished product and what it can be, so much!  I am super proud of this project, and for so many other reasons as well.  Unlike my first project, this came a bit easier to me, and was way more enjoyable.  My layout is simple and focused on the content users are sharing - so believe it or not, there isn't much CSS involved here because the pictures do it all.  Its super cute!  Hoping everyone who uses it enjoys it...and also hoping I can get a ton of people to use it!

### Coding Challenges
1. Remembering to make sure the site was user centric and user specific (i.e. log-in, username, user avatar, user posts and comments).
2. Uploading photos from a photo library - super intricate - and still in the works (not complete).
3. Creating a 'post' form and creating a 'comment' form. 
4. Comment options: edit and delete, being able to cancel either option as well.


## Technologies Used:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. MongoDB
5. Mongoose
